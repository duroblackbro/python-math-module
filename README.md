# Python Basics Projects

This repository contains two basic Python programs as part of a practice assignment:

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

- **Description**:  
  This program defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- **How it works**:
  - If the input number is 0 or 1, it returns 1.
  - Otherwise, it multiplies the number by the factorial of (number - 1).
- **Sample Output**:  
  For input `5`, the output will be:  
  ```
  The factorial of 5 is: 120
  ```

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

- **Description**:  
  This program takes a user input and uses the Python `math` module to perform the following:
  - Calculate the square root of the number
  - Calculate the natural logarithm (base e) of the number
  - Calculate the sine of the number (in radians)
- **Sample Output**:  
  For input `25`, the output will be:
  ```
  Square root of 25.0: 5.0
  Natural logarithm of 25.0: 3.2188758248682006
  Sine of 25.0 (in radians): -0.13235175009777303
  ```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
3. Run each script individually:
   - For Task 1: `python task1_factorial.py`
   - For Task 2: `python task2_math_module.py`
